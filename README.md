JavaFX Simple BMI Calculator (assignment)

This application calculates a person’s Body Mass Index. The BMI is what some people use as an
indicator of whether an individual is underweight, normal, overweight or obese. It is
calculated for the population aged 18 or older, excluding pregnant women and people
shorter than 3 feet (0.914 metres) or taller than 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 metres).

Create the BMI calculator app that allows users to enter:

- [x] Metric or English measurement using Radio Buttons, metric is the default.
- [x] Pregnant, true or false using a checkbox, not pregnant is the default. If true then
the program will inform the user that the calculation is not valid in an Alert box.
- [x] Height in either English or metric and a positive number. If below 3 feet (0.914
metres) or above 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 metres) the program will inform the
user that the calculation is not valid in an Alert box.
- [x] Weight in either English or metric. Weight must be a positive number greater
than 50 and less than 500.
With this information the program calculates the user’s body mass index. The app
should also display the following information from Statistics Canada
